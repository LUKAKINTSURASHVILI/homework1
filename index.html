    <h3>BMW</h3>

    <p>
      Motoren Werke AG, abbreviated as BMW (German pronunciation:), is a German
      multinational manufacturer of performance luxury vehicles and motorcycles
      headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The corporation was founded in
      1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917
      until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

    <h3>AUDI</h3>

    <p>
      The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th
      century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by
      engineer August Horch (1868–1951); and two other manufacturers (DKW and
      Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern
      Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen
      from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965
      introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with
      NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the
      company.
